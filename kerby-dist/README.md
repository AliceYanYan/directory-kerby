Kerby-dist
============

The distribution of Kerby.

### 1. To run with a standalone kdc server, kdcinit, kadmin, kinit and klist

* 1. Generate libraries for distribution:
```
mvn package -Pdist
```

* 2. Run kdcinit:
```
cd kerby-dist/kdc-dist
sh bin/kdcinit.sh [server-conf-dir] [keytab]
```
The admin principal will be exported into [keytab], it will be used by kadmin tool for the authentication. 

* 3. Start kerby-kdc-server:
```
cd kerby-dist/kdc-dist
sh bin/start-kdc.sh [server-conf-dir] [work-dir]
```

* 4. Run kadmin to add or delete principals:
```
cd kerby-dist/kdc-dist
sh bin/kadmin.sh [server-conf-dir] -k [keytab]
```
  The keytab file is created by the kdcinit.
  In kadmin, you can type "?" for help.

* 5. Run kinit:
```
cd kerby-dist/tool-dist
sh bin/kinit.sh -conf [client-conf-dir] [principal-name]
```

* 6. Run klist:
```
cd kerby-dist/tool-dist
sh bin/klist.sh -c [credentials-cache]
```

  If you don't specify [server-conf-dir] in step 2, 3 or 4, it will be set as /etc/kerby. In [server-conf-dir], there should be kdc.conf, backend.conf. 
  And if you don't specify [client-conf-dir] in step 5, it will be set as /etc/, there should be krb5.conf.

An example of kdc.conf:
```
[kdcdefaults]
    kdc_host = localhost
    kdc_tcp_port = 8015
    kdc_realm = TEST.COM
```
An example of json backend backend.conf:
```
kdc_identity_backend = org.apache.kerby.kerberos.kdc.identitybackend.JsonIdentityBackend
backend.json.dir = /tmp/kerby/jsonbackend
```
An example of zookeeper backend backend.conf:
```
kdc_identity_backend = org.apache.kerby.kerberos.kdc.identitybackend.ZookeeperIdentityBackend
data_dir = /tmp/kerby/zookeeper/data
data_log_dir = /tmp/kerby/zookeeper/datalog
```
An example of krb5.conf:
```
[libdefaults]
    kdc_realm=TEST.COM
    kdc_tcp_port = 8015
```

### 2. Anonymous PKINIT configuration
generate a private key:
```
openssl genrsa -out cakey.pem 2048
```

generate the CA certificate:
```
openssl req -key cakey.pem -new -x509 -out cacert.pem -days 3650
```

generate the KDC key:
```
openssl genrsa -out kdckey.pem 2048
```

generate a certificate request:
```
openssl req -new -out kdc.req -key kdckey.pem
```

generate the certificate:
```
openssl x509 -req -in kdc.req -CAkey cakey.pem -CA cacert.pem -out kdc.pem -extfile pkinit_extensions -extensions kdc_cert -CAcreateserial
```

On the KDC, you must set the pkinit_identity variable to provide the KDC certificate.
Configure the following relation in the[kdcdefaults] section of the KDCâ€™s kdc.conf file
```
pkinit_identity = FILE:/var/lib/krb5kdc/kdc.pem,/var/lib/krb5kdc/kdckey.pem
```

On client hosts, you must set the pkinit_anchors variable in order to trust the issuing authority for the KDC certificate. Configure the following relation in krb5.conf file.
```
pkinit_anchors = FILE:/etc/krb5/cacert.pem
```

create the principalWELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS using the command:
```
sh bin/kadmin.sh [server-conf-dir] -k [keytab]
addprinc -randkey WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS
```

To obtain anonymous credentials on a client, run:
```
sh bin/kinit.sh -conf [client-conf-dir] -n
```
The resulting tickets will have the client name WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS@WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS.
